        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons peeled and minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped tomato</li>
        <li>2 cups green beans, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 cup jasmine rice</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chicken stock</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>
            <p>Pat chicken pieces dry; season with salt and pepper.</p>
        </li> 

        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>
            <p>Melt butter in a large casserole or Dutch oven, and sprinkle with turmeric. Add chicken pieces in a single layer and cook over medium-high heat until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and brown the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and keep warm.</p>
        </li> 

        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>
            <p>To the same pot, add onion, ginger, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, green beans, curry powder, cinnamon, cumin, and rice. Stir constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Return chicken and any accumulated juices to the pot, and add bay leaves, fish sauce, and chicken stock. Be sure to stir up all the browned bits from the bottom of the pot into the sauce.</p>
        </li> 

        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>
            <p>Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low; simmer for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make raita.</p>
        </li> 

        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong>
            <p>Adjust the lid to partially cover and vent, and continue to simmer until rice is tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer.</p>
        </li> 
        
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong>
            <p>Remove from heat, uncover, and let stand for 5 minutes. Serve warm, with raita as a garnish, if desired.</p>
        </li> 

        <li><strong>Step 7:</strong>
            <p>For Raita: Stir 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt, 1/3 cup grated, drained cucumber, 1 tablespoon minced fresh mint, 1 1/2 teaspoons lime juice, 1/8 teaspoon garam masala, and 1/8 teaspoon granulated garlic together in a bowl. Season with salt to taste.</p>
