    <h1> New & Improved Chicken Parmesan</h1>
    <p>I love chicken parm, especially when it's made with fresh mozzarella, which it almost never is in restaurants. Of course, at home we can use the real stuff, but it can be pricey. So I tried something new--a cheese spread using ricotta fortified with sharp Cheddar.</p>
